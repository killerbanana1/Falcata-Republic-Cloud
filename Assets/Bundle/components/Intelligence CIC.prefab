  _shortDescription: Command Center
  _longDescription: "The Combat Information Center (CIC) is the central command hub
    that provides command and control for the warship, and is critical in the operation
    of the vessel during an engagement.  This compartment is heavily reinforced and
    resistant to damage.\r\n\r\nThis CIC also features a workspace for a large team
    of intelligence analysts to speed up target identification and do basic battle
    damage assessment, crucially they are able to  process tracks from across the
    entire fleet, albeit much slower than a dedicated compartment. Intelligence effort
    is not additive across multiple ships, or even the same ship, and only the largest
    amount of effort will be used.  However, the speed of these analysts can be increased
    with supporting staff in other compartments.\r\n\r\nDestruction of the CIC results
    in a loss of command and the affected warship cannot receive commands until the
    CIC is repaired.\r"
