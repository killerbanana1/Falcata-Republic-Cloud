  _shortDescription: Fusion Drive
  _longDescription: An under-tuned drive commonly found on nimble gunboats. re-specced
    for acceleration, this drive sacrifices top speed to provide impressive translational
    acceleration while providing a stable platform.
  _flavorText: "The more productive offshoot of the dragoon fleetwide upgrade program,
    the original goal aimed right up at reducing the vulnerability of large hulls
    against early wake homers using ionization reduction, and drive control techniques.
    While the concepts weren\u2019t completely off the mark, advancements in wake
    seeker design \u2018cross the cluster, along with the unmistakeable heat drives
    put out at the bells no matter what they tweaked, meant it didn't take long for
    the design board to stop throwin\u2019 good money after bad. Some ideas from
    the board are better than others, still, a clever bunch at Rhiso Heavy Industries
    got something together for their trouble eventually.\r\n\r\nFor a bastard child,
    they're downright docile. Linear chamber pressure and a diffused radial make
    a mean piece of kit that can get up to speed quickly in her powerband. They'll
    start to taper out at full tilt, with delicate rapid cycle valves and active
    cooling loops getting overwhelmed, not to mention the racket from over-expansion
    against the hull, but for when you need to get movin\u2019 there\u2019s not much
    like it. \r\n\r\n- M. Weaver, CMC\r\n"
