  _shortDescription: Fusion Drive
  _longDescription: 'This small-sized drive system provides power for the main engines
    of smaller warships, while also providing a small amount of reactor power. Accommodations
    for additional bracing, as well as Integrated auxiliary power shunts and reactor
    shutoff systems, provide a reliable drive module for all manner of ships across
    the fleet. '
  _flavorText: "\u2019Dog that caught the car \u2018these. Armor spanning all the
    way to the radial, hell you\u2019d think they\u2019d nixed a blueprint and kept
    going before nobody noticed. Downright minor miracle how the armor squeezes through
    most bay gantries even if it's not unlike moving a sofa. \r\n\r\nDon\u2019t need
    me to tell ya\u2019 they\u2019re a right pain, but I will, and they are. The
    plate blocks most of her outlets, and the only way to get tools close enough
    to the auxiliaries and delicate tokamak controls would be with her coils cold
    on this variety. They keep plenty stable gettin\u2019 clobbered in the fight,
    but ye\u2019 need only shake my hand and know why I don\u2019t dabble \u2018till
    she\u2019s on ice. It\u2019d be a laugh to pull on Murphy though the way he keeps
    his toolbox close. Think he\u2019d bite? \r\n\r\n- M. Weaver, CMC"
